'''
This script demonstrates some applications of the so-called "filter sequence" in LEAP.  The filter sequence
is an extensible feature for which to add multiple regularization filters or "priors" to LEAP iterative reconstruction algorithms.

This feature has many applications and we will slowly add these to this demon script over time.
