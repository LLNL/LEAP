'''
This demo script simulates data using a forward projection of the FORBILD head phantom and then performs
a reconstruction.  This same script can be used to test these features for parallel-, fan-, or cone-beam geometries

All memory for data structures, e.g., the projection data and the volume data are managed in python.
LEAP only tracks the specifications, i.e., geometry of the CT model, the volume parameters,
and a few other parameters that deal with how the code should be run, such as which GPUs to use.
These parameters exist in the C code and are set by python functions in the python class "tomographicModels".
Once these are set, one simply provides the numpy arrays of the projection data and volume data and
LEAP will perform the various operations.

Each of the four geometry types: parallel-, fan-, cone-, and modular-beam has its own function
for which to set its parameters, for example use set_conebeam to set a cone-beam geometry
with certain specifications.

Then one may specify the reconstruction volume specifications such as the number of voxels in each
dimension and the voxel size.  We suggest using the "set_default_volume" function which sets the volume
parameters such that the volume fills the field of view of the CT system and uses the nominal voxel sizes.
Using voxel sizes that are significantly smaller or significantly bigger than this default size may result
in poor computational performance.

# Specify the number of detector columns which is used below
# Scale the number of angles and the detector pixel size with N
numCols = 512

# Set the scanner geometry
# This script can be run for parallel-, fan-, or cone-beam geometries
# Try commenting out different geometry types below to run this sample script for different geometries
# Note that the arguments for each of the three standard geometries are nearly equivalent, except set_fanbeam and set_conebeam have some extra parameters
# that specify the source-to-object distance (sod), the source-to-detector distance (sdd), and tau the horizontal translation of the source position
# set_conebeam also allows users to specify the helicalPitch if they wish but the default for this parameter is zero
# The line below that says: leapct.set_curvedDetector() only applies to cone-beam data and sets the detector to have a shape that is the surface of a cylinder
# whose diameter is given by the source-to-detector distance

# By default, LEAP applies a circular field of view mask to the CT volume.  The diameter of this mask is determined by the 
# CT geometry parameters, but this may be overriden (mask can be made smaller, bigger, or completely removed) by using the
# following function where d is the diameter of the field of view measured in mm

# Also note that algorithm can be run in series.  For example, if you first perform an FBP reconstruction
