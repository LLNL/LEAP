Physics-Based Preprocessing Algorithms
=======================================

The following physics-based algorithms requires the `XrayPhysics <https://github.com/kylechampley/XrayPhysics>`_ software package

`single-material beam hardening correction <https://github.com/LLNL/LEAP/blob/main/demo_leapctype/d17_beam_hardening.py>`_

`two-material beam hardening correction <https://github.com/LLNL/LEAP/blob/main/demo_leapctype/d18_multi-materialBHC.py>`_

`dual energy decomposition and SIRZ <https://github.com/LLNL/LEAP/blob/main/demo_leapctype/d19_dual_energy_decomposition_and_SIRZ.py>`_
